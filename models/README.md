#Model Storage

Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limitation (maximum 25 MB per file), we are unable to upload the trained model files (*.pt, *.h5, *.pth, etc.) directly to this repository.

If you need access to the pre-trained models, please use one of the following methods:

Download from External Storage:
The model files are hosted on [Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive/Zenodo/your cloud link].

Download Link 1 (Google Drive)

Download Link 2 (Backup)

Request by Email:
You can also request the model files by contacting the corresponding author at:

Email: thanhnh@ptit.edu.vn

Re-train Models:
Alternatively, you can retrain the models using the scripts and instructions provided in this repository.
Please refer to the Training Instructions for details.

Note:
We recommend checking the models/ folder for sample code and placeholder files.
All model weights and checkpoints will need to be downloaded separately as described above.
