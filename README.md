This repository contains code and materials for the paper:

**"Enhancing Face Mask Detection Performance with a Comprehensive Dataset and YOLOv8"**

- **Objective:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of face mask detection models using a newly curated, comprehensive dataset and state-of-the-art YOLOv8 architectures.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is **DRFMD: Diverse and Robust Face Mask Dataset**.
- **Download Link:**

- All experiments and model training in this repository are based on this dataset.  
- The dataset is annotated in YOLO format, with three classes: without mask, with mask, and wear mask incorrect.

## Contents
- **Comparison of performance metrics** [(Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95) between FMMD and DRFMD datasets](https://github.com/hthanhsg/Enhancing-face-mask-detection-performance-with-comprehensive-dataset-and-YOLOv8/blob/main/training-and-testing-results-on-yolo-v8-with-fmmd-and-drfmd-datasets.md)
